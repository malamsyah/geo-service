# Geographic Data REST API Service
A RESTful API service built in Go (Golang) with PostgreSQL for handling geographic dataâ€”specifically points and contours. The service supports CRUD operations and advanced spatial queries, including intersection calculations and point-in-polygon queries.

Please refer to the architecture doc for the comprehensive explanation of the project structure [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) 

## Prerequisites

- **Go**: Version 1.16 or higher.
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: For containerization.
- **PostgreSQL**: With PostGIS extension.

The project uses `make` to make your life easier. If you're not familiar with Makefiles you can take a look at [this quickstart guide](https://makefiletutorial.com).
Whenever you need help regarding the available actions, just use the following command.

```bash
make help
```

## Setup

To get your setup up and running the only thing you have to do is

```bash
make all
```

This will initialize a git repo, download the dependencies in the latest versions and install all needed tools.
If needed code generation will be triggered in this target as well.

## Test & lint

Run linting

```bash
make lint
```

Run unit tests

```bash
make test-unit
```

Run repository tests

The tests for repository is separated with actual connection to database, please make sure you have the database running `make start-components`

```bash
make test-repository
```

## Local Development

### Run dependency

```bash
make start-components
```

### Stop dependency

```bash
make stop-components 
```

### Build docker image

```bash
make docker-build
```

### Run the server localy

Copy the `.env.sample` to `.env` and put the appropriate value for your setup, then run:

```bash
make server
```
